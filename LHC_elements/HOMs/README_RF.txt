# HOMs of files LHC_RF_cavities.txt are from:

- LHC Project Report 595, "Review of Coupled Bunch Instabilities in the LHC",
D. Angal-Kalinin.
Note that values there (in Tables 5 and 12) are for 4 cavities (one cryostat),
so we divided them by 4 to have the values for each cavity (note that this is
actually not clearly stated in the case of Table 12...).
The Q and frequency values reproduced there are initially from (damped cavities):
E. Haebel, V. Rodel, F. Gerigk, Z. T. Zhao, "The higher order mode dampers
of the 400 MHz superconducting LHC cavities", CERN-SL-98-008-RF

- Benoit Salvant's talk at INFN HiLumi workshop in Nov. 2012 ("Where are we on 
the impedance model of HL-LHC?"
In transverse, values there are for a displacement of d=5mm. In longitudinal,
to get Rl we need to multiply Benoit's Zl/n by fcutoff/frev=5e9/11245.5
