Hi Nicolo,
as discussed, please find in attachment files with collimator openings for a few different scenarios for 2016. they are the following (all round optics):

a) 40 cm, using the present optics, assuming that the IR7 secondaries go in by 0.5 sig compared to 2015, and that we also can decrease the beam-beam separation from 11 sigma to 10 sigma.

b) 50 cm tight, assuming present optics with not so good phase advance. This has a very similar hierarchy to the 40 cm case, except that the TCTs are more open

c) 50cm, new optics: Here I assume that we can have a new optics with the phase advance MKD-TCT re-matched so that we don't risk to hit TCTs/triplets during asynchronous beam dumps. Obviously, we don't have the optics for this yet. Instead, I just took the present 50cm optics but adjusted the collimator openings in sigma. Of course, the beta functions might change in the new optics, but hopefully this change should be small, and in IR7 it should be zero. We can use this as a working hypothesis, knowing it will change.

Please note that in all cases I have included the TCL6 at 20 sigma. If Totem is not in, this collimator could possibly be retracted if the impedance contribution is bad.

Please let me know if you have any questions... I would also be interested to see the impedance calculations when you have them. Thanks!

Cheers,
Roderik
