sorry for the delay but I finally managed to produced the files you asked for the 2015 machine. I regenerated everything, B1 and B2, using the most up to date optics and the collimator settings used in the machine. Please let me know if you find anything strange. The files are here:

/afs/cern.ch/user/r/rbruce/public/for_nicolo/2015_collgaps

Some comments:

injection protection is out at inejction. Not sure if this is what you want - let me know otherwise

In physics, TCL6 is out. If you want I could also produce a file with the settings when the roman pots and TCL6 are in.

The file for HL pre-squeeze will follow soon.

Cheers,
Roderik
